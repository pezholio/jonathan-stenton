Whether seen as an alternative to a life of serious crime, an opportunity for creative expression, or merely the thrill of the chase, the pirate radio scene in London has had a personal impact on both the characters explored in the film and youth culture around the United Kingdom. Drowned City reveals the passion and dedication within these anonymous individuals, as we watch them serve their communities through illegal activity.

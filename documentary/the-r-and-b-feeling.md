Meet Bob Parks, whose career started out some forty years back, when he first entered into the arena of performance art during the sixties and early seventies. Born in the UK, Bob moved to South Central Los Angeles in 1972, where he immersed himself in various aspects of avant-garde culture and simply 'living it out'.

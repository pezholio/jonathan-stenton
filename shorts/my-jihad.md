To find the girl of his dreams, Nazir goes along to an Islamic speed-dating evening. But all he finds are women keen to know how he'd support a wife financially and, as Nazir isn't able to support himself financially, it's all a little disastrous. My Jihad is a tender and funny love story of a chance meeting on the night bus home.
